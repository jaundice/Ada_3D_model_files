This repositorty contains all the CAD models for Open Bionics products. 
The files are created in Blender, a free to use program available from www.blender.com

Please note that there is currently a problem with how Blender opens these files. Modifiers involving an objects own child are not implemented at start up. However, they do not create any errors and work perfectly if the modifier stacks for each object are "refreshed". This can be done by various methods but the easiest is starting a render. 
**In summary: On opening the file add a camera (Shift+A), press F12 to render, instantly cancel the render with Esc, then remove the camera.**
